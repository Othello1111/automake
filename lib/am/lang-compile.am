## Preprocessed Fortran.  ##
## ---------------------- ##

## We also handle the case of preprocessing `.F/.fpp' files into `.f'
## files.  autoconf determines whether the Fortran compiler can
## compile preprocessable source directly (so-called `direct'
## compilation) or whether the code must be preprocessed separately
## (`indirect').  In the former case, it sets FPP_PREPROCESS_EXT to be
## some dummy value, so that the rule is not used; in the latter case,
## it sets it to be $FPP_SRC_EXT (which is `fpp' or `F', as
## appropriate).
##
## Even in direct mode, emit a useful rule here, since in this case
## autoconf has set FPP_PREPROCESS_EXT to a useful but harmless value
## such as .f_in.  This can be used either for user debugging, or to
## help the user if they need to do some by-hand preprocessing for some
## reason.
##
## It's also seems quite important to avoid having .F as the source in two
## different suffix rules.
##
## Avoiding `.F.f' is not just for configurability, but because
## automake subroutine file_contents_internal, with the help of
## Automake::Rule::define, appears to be a little bit too smart and
## discards a rule `.F.f:'.

if %?PPFC%
# The following rule preprocesses a Fortran preprocessor input file
# foo.@FPP_PREPROCESS_EXT@ into a compiler input file foo.f.
.@FPP_PREPROCESS_EXT@.f:
	$(FPP) $(DEFS) $(DEFAULT_INCLUDES) $(INCLUDES) $(FPPFLAGS) $(AM_CPPFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< @FPP_OUTPUT@
